MABLE BACKEND CODE CHALLENGE EXPLANATION
=======================================

TASK OVERVIEW
-------------
The task was to implement a banking service that:
1. Loads account balances from a CSV file
2. Processes daily transfers from another CSV file
3. Ensures accounts cannot go below $0
4. Handles 16-digit account numbers
5. Processes transfers between accounts

IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
-----------------------
1. Technology Stack:
   - TypeScript: Chosen for type safety and better code organization
   - Node.js: For file system operations and CSV parsing
   - Jest: For comprehensive testing

2. Architecture:
   - Domain-Driven Design: Separated business logic into domain models
   - Service Layer: Implemented services for file reading and banking operations
   - Error Handling: Custom error types for different scenarios

3. Key Components:
   a. Domain Models:
      - AccountEntity: Represents bank accounts with validation
      - TransactionEntity: Represents money transfers between accounts
      - Custom Errors: For specific banking scenarios

   b. Services:
      - FileReaderService: Handles CSV file reading and parsing
      - BankingService: Manages account operations and transactions

4. Testing Strategy:
   - 100% test coverage
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Edge case handling
   - Error scenario testing

WHY THIS APPROACH?
-----------------
1. Type Safety:
   - TypeScript provides compile-time checks
   - Reduces runtime errors
   - Better code maintainability

2. Domain-Driven Design:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Business logic encapsulation
   - Easy to extend and modify

3. Comprehensive Testing:
   - Ensures reliability
   - Catches edge cases
   - Documents expected behavior

4. Error Handling:
   - Specific error types for different scenarios
   - Clear error messages
   - Graceful failure handling

5. File Processing:
   - Efficient CSV parsing
   - Data validation
   - Error handling for malformed files
